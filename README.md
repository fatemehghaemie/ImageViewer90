hello this is ImageViewerGUI . i use this site(https://www.javatpoint.com/java-swing) for making it .
the question is what can this program do ? when you run this code you can see 6 buttons (Choose Image,Show Image
Brightness,Gray scale,Resize,Exit) . first you can access your files  and choose your image  by click on choose Image 
, you can see your image by click on Show Image , you can adjust brightness by click on Brightness(you should write a number
between 0 to 1 , you can make your image gray scale by click on Gray scale .
